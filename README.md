## 📂 Problems List

### 🔹 Problem 14 – Pattern Printing Dashboard
Menu-driven pattern printer (Right-angle, Pyramid, Diamond).  
Uses: for loop, nested loops, break, continue.  

### 🔹 Problem 15 – Prime Analyzer
Finds all primes up to N using for-else.  
Stores in an array and prints count, smallest, largest.  
Checks if N itself is prime.  

### 🔹 Problem 16 – Student Marks with Arrays
Input marks of students, stored in an array.  
Prints average, highest, lowest.  
Stops if any student fails (<40) using break.  
Pass used if no student is added.  

### 🔹 Problem 17 – Number Pattern with Conditions
Input N.  
Skip even numbers using continue.  
Stop if divisible by 13 using break.  
Otherwise print star pattern.  

### 🔹 Problem 18 – Password Strength Checker
Checks if password contains digit, uppercase, lowercase, special char.  
If all present → Strong, else Weak.  
Empty password handled with pass.  

### 🔹 Problem 19 – Fibonacci Prime Filter
Generates first N Fibonacci numbers.  
Uses for-else to find primes among them.  
Stores primes in an array.  

### 🔹 Problem 20 – Library Book Borrow System
Menu-driven program.  
Options: Show books, Search, Borrow, Exit.  
Uses loops, break, continue.  

### 🔹 Problem 21 – Multiplication Table Manager
Prints multiplication table using for loop.  
Negative input → exit (break).  
Zero input → skip (pass).  

### 🔹 Problem 22 – Array Statistics Dashboard
Menu options: Show all, Odd/Even, Prime numbers, Reverse, Exit.  
Uses arrays, for-else, break/continue.

### 🔹 Problem 23 – Student Result Analyzer (NumPy + Functions)
Stores marks of students in NumPy array.  
Functions: subject-wise average, highest, lowest.  
Student totals, averages, topper detection.  
Demonstrates positional, keyword, and default arguments.  

### 🔹 Problem 24 – Image Filter Simulator (Matrix with NumPy)
3×3 NumPy matrix as grayscale image.  
Functions: Brighten, Darken, Transpose.  
Demonstrates array manipulation inside functions.  

### 🔹 Problem 25 – Array Copy & Independence Check
Creates shallow and deep copies of NumPy arrays.  
Shows how shallow copy changes with original, but deep copy remains independent.  
Wrapped in function `check_copy_behavior()`.  

### 🔹 Problem 26 – Bank Account Manager (Global vs Local)
Global balance variable with deposit, withdraw, check.  
Demonstrates global keyword and local shadowing.  

### 🔹 Problem 27 – Polynomial Calculator (NumPy + Functions)
Takes two polynomials as NumPy arrays.  
Functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication (using `np.poly*`).  
Pretty print in polynomial form (e.g., `3x² + 2x + 1`).
